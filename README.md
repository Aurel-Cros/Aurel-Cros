# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer from France, although I am very comfortable with the english language. Unexpected for a frenchie, I know.

I am focused on the Javascript environment, specifically React and Node at the moment. I know how to use Webpack and Vite, I have worked with Three.js a bit as well... and I'm always up for picking up a new tech !

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning my first batch of frameworks.

Symfony and React, to be precise. On a longer term, my current goal is to get my professional certificate as a Web Developer. Early 2024 should do the trick ! ðŸ¤ž

## Available for work starting February 2024 ! âœ¨
