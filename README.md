# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Aurel-Cros&layout=donut&theme=nightowl&bg_color=90,011627,042f4f" alt="Mes stats" align="right" />

I'm a web developer from France, although I am very comfortable with the english language. 

Unexpected for a frenchie, I know.

I am focused on the Javascript environment, specifically React and Node (with TypeScript ! ) at the moment. I also know my way around Symfony, and I'm always up for picking up a new tech anyways !

I enjoy and know my way around Lightroom and Photoshop, or photography in general. :v:

## Goals

### Recent achievements

- [x] Learning Typescript ! Strongly typed code is a key component nowadays, and it's an important step a wanted to take.
- [x] Building a solid micro services architecture with Docker, including a Redis cache, proper logging, monitoring, and robust error handling.

### Major

- [ ] Being involved in a long-term project, with a focus on quality rather than quick & dirty productivity.
- [ ] Learning Rust ? It seems WebAssembly will be a major technology for quicker web apps in the coming years, I'm keeping my eye on it.

### Minor 

- [ ] Learning Laravel. Knowing Symfony is handy, but knowing both would open most of the PHP world to me.

## Available for work starting September 2024 ! âœ¨
